1. Git vs. other version control systems:

    Ans: Git is distributed, meaning each user has a full copy of the repository, unlike centralized systems, which rely on a central server.

2. git commit vs. git push:

    Ans: git commit saves changes locally, while git push uploads changes to a remote repository.

3. Remote repository in Git:

    Ans: A remote repository is a version of your project hosted online. You add it using:
         git remote add <name> <url>

4. Fork in GitHub:

    Ans: A fork is a personal copy of a repository. It's used to make changes in an independent copy, especially for contributing to open-source projects.
